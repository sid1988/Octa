3  

Sample Output

Sample Output 1

	X is greater than Y  

Sample Output 2

	X is equal to Y   

Sample Output 3

	X is less than Y  

Solution:

#!/bin/bash
read X
read Y

if [ $X -eq $Y ]
then
    echo 'X is equal to Y'
fi

if [ $X -gt $Y ]
then
    echo 'X is greater than Y'
fi

if [ $X -lt $Y ]
then
    echo 'X is less than Y'
fi
